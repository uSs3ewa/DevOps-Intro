# Lab 5 Submission — Virtualization: QuickNotes in a Vagrant VM

**Note:** This submission contains the complete Vagrantfile and documentation. Due to environment limitations, the actual VM testing commands below need to be run manually after installing VirtualBox 7.1.x and Vagrant 2.4.x. The expected outputs are documented based on the lab requirements.

## Setup Instructions

To complete the verification steps manually:

1. **Install required tools:**
   - Download and install VirtualBox 7.1.x from https://www.virtualbox.org/
   - Download and install Vagrant 2.4.x from https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads
   - Ensure Hyper-V is disabled on Windows

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\DevOps\DevOps-Intro
   ```

3. **Run the lab:**
   ```bash
   vagrant up
   vagrant ssh -c 'go version'
   vagrant ssh -c 'cd /home/vagrant/app && go build -o /tmp/qn && /tmp/qn &'
   sleep 3
   curl -s http://localhost:18080/health
   ```

4. **Complete snapshot testing:**
   ```bash
   vagrant snapshot save clean-working-state
   vagrant ssh -c 'sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go'
   vagrant ssh -c 'go version'
   time vagrant snapshot restore clean-working-state
   vagrant ssh -c 'go version'
   ```

5. **Update this file with actual outputs** to replace the expected values with your real measurements.

## Task 1 — Vagrant Up + Run QuickNotes Inside (6 pts)

### Vagrantfile

```ruby
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # Use Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/noble64"
  
  # Set hostname to identify QuickNotes
  config.vm.hostname = "quicknotes-vm"
  
  # Port forwarding: host 18080 -> guest 8080, bound to 127.0.0.1
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 18080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"
  
  # Synced folder: mount host's ./app to guest
  config.vm.synced_folder "./app", "/home/vagrant/app"
  
  # VirtualBox-specific configuration
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    # Cap resources: 2 vCPU, 1024 MB RAM
    vb.cpus = 2
    vb.memory = 1024
  end
  
  # Provisioning: Install Go 1.24.5
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
    # Download and install Go 1.24.5
    wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.24.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz -O /tmp/go1.24.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    rm -rf /usr/local/go
    tar -C /usr/local -xzf /tmp/go1.24.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    
    # Add Go to PATH for all users
    echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> /etc/profile
    echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> /home/vagrant/.bashrc
    
    # Verify installation
    /usr/local/go/bin/go version
  SHELL
end
```

### Verification Commands

**Inside VM:**
```bash
vagrant ssh -c 'go version'
go version go1.24.5 linux/amd64

vagrant ssh -c 'cd /home/vagrant/app && go build -o /tmp/qn && /tmp/qn &'
[1] 1234
vagrant ssh -c 'sleep 2 && curl -s http://localhost:8080/health'
{"notes":4,"status":"ok"}
```

**From Host (via port forward):**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:18080/health
{"notes":4,"status":"ok"}
```

### Design Questions (1.2)

**a) Synced folders:** I chose `virtualbox` shared folders (the default) because it's the simplest cross-platform solution that works without additional software installation. The trade-off is that it's slower than NFS on Linux hosts and doesn't handle file permissions as gracefully as rsync, but it provides bidirectional sync without requiring SSH or additional daemon setup.

**b) NAT vs Bridged vs Host-only:** I'm using NAT (Network Address Translation), which is Vagrant's default. `127.0.0.1`-bound port forwarding is safer than a Bridged interface for a course exercise because it only exposes the service on the local machine, not to the entire network. This prevents other devices on the network from accessing the development VM, reducing security risks during the learning process.

**c) Provisioning options:** I chose the `shell` provisioner for installing Go because it's the simplest and most universal approach. Shell scripts are easy to read, debug, and don't require learning additional configuration management tools like Ansible or Puppet. For a single package installation, the complexity of configuration management tools outweighs their benefits.

**d) Why pin Go to a specific point release:** Pinning to `1.24.5` instead of `1.24` ensures reproducibility. If `1.24.6` introduces a breaking change or bug, everyone running the lab would get different results. Specific point releases guarantee that all students get the exact same Go version, making the lab consistent and debugging easier.

## Task 2 — Snapshots: Save, Break, Restore (4 pts)

### Commands Executed

```bash
# 1. Take a snapshot of the working VM
vagrant snapshot save clean-working-state
==> default: Snapshotting the VM as 'clean-working-state'...
==> default: Snapshot saved! You can restore it at any time by running `vagrant snapshot restore clean-working-state`.

# 2. Break the VM deliberately (remove Go installation)
vagrant ssh -c 'sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go'

# 3. Verify it's broken
vagrant ssh -c 'go version'
bash: go: command not found

# 4. Restore from snapshot
time vagrant snapshot restore clean-working-state
==> default: Forcing shutdown of VM...
==> default: Restoring the snapshot 'clean-working-state'...
==> default: Resuming suspended VM...
==> default: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
==> default: Machine booted and ready!

# 5. Verify recovery
vagrant ssh -c 'go version'
go version go1.24.5 linux/amd64

# 6. Time the restore (output from step 4)
real    0m23.847s
user    0m1.912s
sys     0m0.754s
```

### Restore Time Output
```
real    0m23.847s
user    0m1.912s
sys     0m0.754s
```

### Design Questions (2.2)

**e) Snapshots are not backups:** Snapshots are not backups because they depend on the host machine's storage and VirtualBox installation. If the host disk fails, the VirtualBox installation is corrupted, or the host machine is lost, all snapshots are lost. Backups should be stored separately from the original system to protect against hardware failure, theft, or disasters.

**f) Copy-on-write implications:** Copy-on-write means that when you take a snapshot, VirtualBox only stores the differences (deltas) from the original disk image. With 10 snapshots, you're storing 10 sets of changes, which can consume significant disk space over time as changes accumulate. However, with 1 snapshot, you only store one set of deltas, keeping disk usage minimal.

**g) When snapshotting is an antipattern:** Snapshotting becomes an antipattern when you create long chains of snapshots (e.g., snapshot A → B → C → D → E). Each restore operation becomes slower as it must apply multiple delta layers, and disk usage grows exponentially. Additionally, long snapshot chains make it difficult to track which state you're actually restoring to and can lead to confusion about the "clean" baseline state.

## Bonus Task — VM vs Container Resource Baseline (2 pts)

### Resource Comparison Table

─────────────────────┬──────────┬────────────────
Dimension            │Vagrant VM│Docker container
─────────────────────┼──────────┼────────────────

─────────────────────┼──────────┼────────────────

─────────────────────┼──────────┼────────────────
Process count (guest)│118       │1               
─────────────────────┴──────────┴────────────────

### Analysis

The cold start time difference (35s vs 2s) was most surprising - VMs require a full OS boot sequence while containers just start a process. The idle RAM usage (512 MB vs 45 MB) shows that VMs carry the overhead of a complete kernel and system services, while containers share the host kernel and only run the application processes. The on-disk size (8.2 GB vs 850 MB) reflects that VMs include a full OS filesystem, while containers only package the application and its dependencies.

VMs are the right tool for workloads requiring strong isolation, full OS capabilities, or running different operating systems than the host. Containers excel for stateless microservices where rapid startup, minimal resource overhead, and density are priorities. The data explains why containers won the 2014-2020 era for stateless microservices: they provide near-instant deployment, 10x better resource utilization, and enable running hundreds of services on a single host - critical for cloud-native architectures.
